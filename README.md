# SLPNet_pytorch
SLPNet: Towards End-to-End Car License Plates Detection and Recognition Using Lightweight CNN

## Background
This is a model for Automatic License Plate Detection and Recognition, which is trained on CCPD. Hence, it only supports Chinese Blue LPs.

## Install
Now we just provide a demonstration for fun. But it's the best model we have trained and can show our SLPNet's performance.<br>
Just run the main.py and a interface (by PyQt5) will appear and it's easy to operate.<br>
'python main.py'

## Environment
Pytorch >= 1.1.0<br>
Opnecv<br>
numpy<br>
PyQt5<br>

## Others
The entire codes include train.py and test.py will be available soon.
