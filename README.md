# SLPNet_pytorch
SLPNet: Towards End-to-End Car License Plates Detection and Recognition Using Lightweight CNN

##Background
This is a model for Automatic License Plate Detection and Recognition, which is trained on CCPD. Hence, it only supports Chinese Blue LPs.

##Install
Now we just provide a demonstration for fun. But it's the best model we have trained and can show our SLPNet's performance.
Just run the main.py and a interface (by PyQt5) will appear and it's easy to operate.

##Environment
Pytorch >= 1.1.0
Opnecv
numpy
PyQt5
